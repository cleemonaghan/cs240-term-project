## Project Vision Statement:

FOR teachers
WHO have a lot of digital/code-based assignements that need a standardized grading system
THE GradeBook Code is a grading environment
THAT streamlines and standardizes grading student assignments that are paper based, digital, or coding.

## Personas:

### Instructor:

John, a computer science teacher

John, age 35, is a computer science teacher at a large high school in Tacoma with over 1500 students. Originally from Portland, he has a diploma in computer science from Ohio University. He moved to Tacoma a few years after graduation after being offered a position as a computer science teacher. He is married and has two children, ages 9 and 6, and enjoys the stability of his job.

With rising student interest in computer science courses, John has been struggling to keep up with grading student code in a timely manner, while still giving them the quality feedback that they need to grow. GradeBook Code’s capabilities for automated code testing will help John to keep up with the workload and maintain his high standards for communication with his students.

### Student Grader:

Henry, a computer science student at a local tech college

Henry, age 20, is a student at a Tacoma tech college studying computer science. Born and raised in Tacoma, Henry is seeking a diploma in computer science from his college. After college, he plans on entering the software engineering workforce in the local area. He has been looking for part-time work relevant to his computer science interests in order to build a stronger resume and portfolio.

Recently, Henry was made aware of the need for computer science graders at his local high school. Seeing the opportunity, Henry applied for a position to grade for his former teacher. GradeBook Code will help Henry to follow the guidelines set by the teacher and provide him the tools to grade efficiently and consistently to the teacher’s standards.

### Student:

Amanda, a high school student

Amanda, age 17, is a junior at a high school in Tacoma. She is currently enrolled in an intro computer science course and is curious about learning more about the topic. She struggles with Strings and basic Java syntax, but it is difficult to get one-on-one help and tutorage from her teacher due to the large class size. She wants to understand why her code failed to run properly before she has to turn in her next assignment.

## Scenarios:

### Scenario 1:

John creates a new assignment for his class, attaching his grading rubric to the assignment so that students are aware of his rubric in advance. When Amanda finishes her assignment and can turn it in on the site for John to grade. John wants the students to be aware of how he will be grading their most recent assignment before they turn it in. He creates the rubric and puts it on GradeBook Code for the students to easily be able to view.

### Scenario 2:

John asks Henry to grade the most recent assignment. John applies a rubric for Henry to use. Henry has 3 days to grade it. John approaches his grader Henry about grading the most recent assignment. He asks Henry to grade the assignment based on the rubric he created. Each item on the rubric has a list of potential cases to check for, along with the point deductions associated with each case. Henry inspects each student’s submission for syntax errors, highlighting each error and attaching a quick message with each highlight indicating what was wrong.

John wants to grade the assignments with unit testing, but he doesn’t want to manually run each case. GradeBook Code has a feature to auto run John’s specified unit tests, and return the results of the test in an easily digestible format. Thus, John can ask Henry to run the unit tests on the assignment and review the outputted results to assist his endeavors to grade for the assignment as well as pinpoint errors in their code.
When Henry is done grading the assignments, he informs John, and John can sign into GradeBook Code to review the grades.

### Scenario 3:

Once John and/or Henry are finished grading the assignment, they can post the grades for Amanda and her classmates to see. The students have privacy over their grades, ie. Amanda can only see her grade (not her classmates) and her classmates cannot see her grade. John, with Henry’s help, have just finished grading a batch of assignments for John’s computer science course. Henry has just John an email saying he has finished looking through the student’s code and grading the rubric. John uses his secure login to enter into GradeBook Code with staff permissions and goes to check the assignment page. With his staff account, John can see the assignment page for each student, as well as their graded rubric as filled out by Henry. Other than Henry, who has a grader account allowing him to fill out rubrics and see student assignments, nobody else can see assignments that they themselves had not filled out. After a quick look at Henry’s work, John enables students to see the graded feedback on their assignments.

### Scenario 4:

Amanda scored poorly on her previous assignment. She can review it on our product’s site to identify common syntax errors that she made and learn how to properly write that section for next time. Bad lines of code were highlighted, allowing her to easily identify her mistakes and the grader left comments attached to the highlighted section informing her how to better write the lines of code.
Amanda was unsure on the syntax to create new arrays in java. She and the rest of her classmates just turned in homework #5, which involved creating and filling arrays in Java. After a couple of days, John mentions in class that the grades have been posted for homework #5 on GradeBook Code.

Amanda is eager for feedback for the assignment, though she does not think she did particularly well, it is a low weighted homework and she is determined to improve. She logs onto GradeBook Code and goes to the assignment page. On this page, she can see the rubric criteria it was graded on and her points earned on each criteria. Within the rubric, she looks over John’s comments to see why he removed points or what he thought was good.

After assessing her overall grade, she looks at her submission where she can see comments connected to sections of her code, as well as the output that John got from the tests. From these comments, she can pinpoint the areas she struggled in and see what to do to improve next time. The clear and quick feedback allows her to start reviewing these areas to prepare for the upcoming exam.
